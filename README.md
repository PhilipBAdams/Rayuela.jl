# Rayuela.jl

Rayuela.jl is a package for fast search of high-dimensional (d=100-1000s)
dense vectors. The package is mostly focused on vector quantization techniques,
and is loosely inspired by [faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss).

Rayuela implements the main contributions that I made to this problem during my
PhD at UBC. It is my attempt to make my research reproducible and accessible.
